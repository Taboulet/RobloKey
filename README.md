# RobloKey
Easily finds and displays the Roblox access code (and the entire launch info) from the current page, to mae it short it's an easy tool to get some gibberish code to easily join a private server ifrom a command line.

(the code doesn't include something like your personnal token so you can share it without an issue, but i wouldn't recommend it anyway)
